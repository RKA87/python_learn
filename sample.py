# Task 2
# You are required to create a stop watch that displays the elapsed time in the 
# format MM:SS that stops after a certain condition is met (say when the count reaches 100).

# inp = int(input("Enter Counter Input:"))
# counter = 0
# for i in range(inp,0,-1):
#     counter +=1
#     if i != 100:
#         print("Time Format:", i,counter)
